# SC4002 Data Analytics & Mining 

## A Python implementation of the Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) algorithm for sequential pattern mining

This project implements the Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) algorithm to find frequent sequences within a given
dataset. The dataset comprises human mobility data from four metropolitan areas in Japan, anonymized to ensure individual privacy. 
This data includes spatial and temporal information for human activities over 75 days at a resolution of 500-meter grid cells.
